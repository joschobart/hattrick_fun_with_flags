  <p><b>Purpose:</b> Fun with Flags allows you to automate capturing flags on <a href="http://hattrick.org" target="_blank">hattrick.org</a> if you are a nerdy supporter of the infamous online-game like myself.</p>

  <p>The project was created out of frustration about having to click around for a total of hours only to challenge the available maximum of 25 opponents for the friendlies every single week.</p>
  
  <p>FwF takes that burden of having to click through league after league of you and lets you use your time for more valuable things.</p>
  
  {% if session['username'] %}
  <p><b>Change-log:</b>
  <ul type="1">
    <li><b>2024-05-02: </b>Fixed opening hours for challenging on flag-details-page.
    <li><b>2024-03-28: </b>Re-designed login- and index-page.
  </ul>
  </p>
  {% else %}
  <p><b>How-to:</b>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('auth.authorize') }}">Log-in with CHPP</a></li>
    <li>Follow the authorization process</li>
    <li>Authorize Fun with Flags</li>
    <li>Back on FwF click the flag you want to grab</li>
    <li>Click on "Challenge"</li>
    <li>That's it! The rest is done by Fun with flags for you!:)</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  {% endif %}
  
  <p><b>Limitations/ features:</b> For now only mass-booking Friendlies is possible. In the future features like pattern-based flag-capturing (e.g.: all flags of Latin America), missions, achievements and scheduled complete auto-pilot capturing are planned. Stay tuned!;)</p>
