  <p><b>Purpose:</b> Fun with Flags allows you to automate capturing flags on <a href="http://hattrick.org" target="_blank">hattrick.org</a> if you are a nerdy supporter of the infamous online-game like myself.</p>

  <p>The project was created out of frustration about having to click around for a total of hours only to challenge the available maximum of 25 opponents for the friendlies every single week.</p>
  
  <p>FwF takes that burden of having to click through league after league of you and lets you use your time for more valuable things.</p>
